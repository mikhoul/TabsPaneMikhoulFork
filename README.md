# Visual Tab Manager 
*Forked from TabsPane Chrome Extension*

This fork is is a complete overhaul of the original, more compact, more pleasant for the eyes (in my taste) ðŸ˜‰. It is also optimized for users who use many many tabs and that also use the "discard" function in Chrome to save memory.

Most other extension of this type use screenshoot thumbnails to show you the tabs but when you use the discard function to save memory throught extension slike "The grat Discarder" instead of seeing thumbnails you just see a white empty thubnail  so it tell you nothing about the tabs and it's a waste of screenspace.

Technically the problem is that when a tab is "discarded" there is no way to take a screenshot of those tabs so you end with a lot of empty white squares in Tabulator extension and it's really annoying. Here's the URL for this issue I've opened with Chromium: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=852239

Also since I use lot of tabs I don't want big thumbnails/cards to see the content of my tabs, I prefer to have smaller tabs witt all the informations I need and be able to se more tabs at the same time instead of having to scroll to see which tabs I have in my session. 

Another problem I'e found with screenshoot is that you can't write readable information over the pictures/screenshot since their color can be any color from dark to white so it make it hard to read. If you put a solid background over the screenshot you hide it, and translucent background is not efficient to be able to read it easily. There is no CSS property that can adapt automatically to change the color of the text over pictures that change dynamically.  

So after many test I've opted to remove the screenshot function for the extension and to use the Favicons that the websites use to identify themselve and make it bigger instead of the screenshot. With the big favicons it's easy to identify from which website the tabs is originataing, also the favicon don't cover all the "cards" so just belor there is the Tittle of the page and just below there is the firs 20 character of the URL.

***A little Trick:*** If you have many "Youtube" tabs just write youtube.com to see all your youtube openned tabs at once.
